# dotfiles

Your [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) are how you personalize your system.

Hereâ€™s how I set up mine.

## About ðŸ”­

Everythingâ€™s built around topic areas. Each topic has its own directory.

There are a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **Brewfile**: Contains a list of tools for [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) to install. You might want to edit this file before running any initial setup.
- **bin/**: Anything in here will get added to your `$PATH`.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your environment.
- **topic/path.zsh**: Files named `path.zsh` are loaded first and are expected to set up `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.zsh**: Files named `completion.zsh` are loaded last and are expected to set up autocomplete.
- **topic/install.sh**: Files named `install.sh` are executed when you run `script/install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, their extension is `.sh`, not `.zsh`.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Files named `*.symlink` get symlinked into your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep them versioned in your dotfiles repo while also making them available in your home directory.

## Installation ðŸª›

To get started, run:

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/pmeinhardt/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# Change into the new directory
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Run the bootstrap script
./script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files to your home directory.

The `bin/dot` tool is a simple helper which installs dependencies, sets sane OS defaults, and so on.
Tweak and occasionally run `dot` to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date.

If you would like to install [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) to an alternative location, e.g. `~/Developer/Homebrew`, do so before running the bootstrap script.
